- Background: Dynamic gradient background
- Task items: Clean white cards with subtle shadows

### Adding Features
The modular JavaScript architecture makes it easy to extend:

```javascript
// Example: Adding a priority system
addTask(text, priority = 'normal') {
    const task = {
        id: Date.now(),
        text: text,
        priority: priority,
        completed: false,
        createdAt: new Date()
    };
    // ... rest of the method
}
```

## 🔧 Development

### Code Structure
- **TodoApp Class**: Main application logic
- **Event Handling**: Centralized event binding
- **State Management**: In-memory task storage with extensible save/load methods
- **DOM Manipulation**: Efficient rendering and updates

### Extending Persistence
The application includes placeholder methods for data persistence:

```javascript
// Enable localStorage persistence
saveTasks() {
    localStorage.setItem('todoTasks', JSON.stringify(this.tasks));
}

loadTasks() {
    const saved = localStorage.getItem('todoTasks');
    if (saved) {
        this.tasks = JSON.parse(saved);
    }
}
```
